# Kana AI Learning Assistant - Recent Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Speech Recognition "Aborted" Errors ✅
**Problem**: Frequent "aborted" error messages in console when speech recognition restarted
**Solution**: 
- Improved error handling to filter out normal "aborted" errors
- Added quieter restart logic for speech recognition
- Reduced console noise while maintaining functionality

### 2. Gemini AI Response Issues ✅
**Problem**: API consistently returning "Sorry, I wasn't able to generate a response"
**Solutions**:
- **Relaxed Safety Settings**: Changed from `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` to `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`
- **Improved Response Parsing**: Better handling of different response structures and safety blocks
- **Enhanced Prompt**: More educational, friendly tone less likely to trigger filters
- **Better Fallback Responses**: When API fails, provide meaningful educational guidance instead of generic errors
- **Increased Token Limit**: From 800 to 1000 tokens for more complete responses

### 3. Enhanced User Experience ✅
**Improvements**:
- **Smart Fallback**: When AI is unavailable, show helpful learning strategies and study tips
- **Better Error Messages**: Distinguish between rate limits and other failures
- **Educational Focus**: Fallback responses still provide value even without AI
- **Context Awareness**: Include page content in fallback responses

## Technical Changes

### Speech Recognition (`content.js`)
```javascript
// Before: Logged all errors including normal "aborted" events
this.recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  console.error('Speech recognition error:', event.error);
  // ...
}

// After: Smart error filtering
this.recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  switch (event.error) {
    case 'aborted':
      console.log('Speech recognition was stopped/restarted');
      break;
    // ... handle other cases appropriately
  }
}
```

### AI Response Processing
```javascript
// Before: Generic fallback message
let aiResponseText = "Sorry, I wasn't able to generate a response.";

// After: Smart response parsing with helpful fallbacks
let aiResponseText = null;
let wasBlocked = false;

// Check for safety blocks and provide appropriate educational responses
if (candidate.finishReason === 'SAFETY') {
  wasBlocked = true;
  // Provide educational guidance instead
}
```

### Safety Settings
```javascript
// Before: Restrictive settings
safetySettings: [{
  category: "HARM_CATEGORY_*",
  threshold: "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"
}]

// After: More permissive for educational content
safetySettings: [{
  category: "HARM_CATEGORY_*", 
  threshold: "BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH"
}]
```

## User Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console**: No more spam from speech recognition errors
2. **Always Helpful**: Even when AI fails, users get educational guidance
3. **Better Success Rate**: More AI responses due to relaxed safety settings
4. **Professional Experience**: Graceful degradation instead of error messages
5. **Educational Value**: Fallback responses still teach learning strategies
