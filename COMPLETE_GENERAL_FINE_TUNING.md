- **Correction**: Proper capitalization ‚Üí "How do I use React hooks"
- **AI Response**: Context-aware React guidance with React documentation references

### Game Development
- **Voice**: "What is a game object in unity"
- **Correction**: "What is a GameObject in Unity"
- **AI Response**: Unity-specific guidance with GameObject documentation

### Data Science
- **Voice**: "How do I use pan das for data analysis"
- **Correction**: "How do I use pandas for data analysis"
- **AI Response**: Data science context with pandas documentation

### General Programming
- **Voice**: "Explain object oriented programming"
- **Correction**: "Explain object-oriented programming"
- **AI Response**: OOP concepts with relevant programming resources

## üìä Expected Results

### ‚úÖ **Improved Accuracy**
- Speech recognition now correctly handles technical terms across ALL domains
- AI provides more relevant, domain-specific guidance
- Better educational resource suggestions for any technology

### ‚úÖ **Reduced Console Spam**
- Theme updates are properly throttled
- System performance optimized
- Cleaner debug output

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Experience**
- More accurate voice recognition for ANY technical topic
- Better AI responses regardless of the technology being discussed
- Comprehensive educational support across all domains

### ‚úÖ **Universal Coverage**
- Works equally well for web dev, game dev, data science, mobile, DevOps, etc.
- Not limited to Unity/VR - supports ANY technical learning context
- Scales to new technologies and domains

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Test voice commands with various technical terms**:
   - Web development: "java script", "react j s", "h t m l"
   - Game development: "game object", "ray cast"
   - Data science: "machine learning", "neural network"
   - General programming: "object oriented", "algorithm"

2. **Verify AI responses for different domains**:
   - Ask web development questions
   - Ask game development questions
   - Ask data science questions
   - Ask mobile development questions

3. **Check educational resource suggestions**:
   - Ensure relevant videos are suggested for each domain
   - Verify documentation references are appropriate
   - Test YouTube integration works across all topics

4. **Performance testing**:
   - Verify console spam is reduced
   - Check theme updates are throttled
   - Ensure adaptive styling still works

## üìù Architecture Notes

- **Modular Design**: Each helper method serves a specific purpose and can be easily extended
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new technical domains and terminology
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between speech recognition, AI processing, and educational resources
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Error Resilient**: Robust error handling and fallbacks throughout
