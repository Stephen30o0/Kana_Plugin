# Placeholder for Kana Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons in various sizes:

- kana16.png (16x16) - Browser toolbar icon
- kana32.png (32x32) - Extension management page  
- kana48.png (48x48) - Extension details page
- kana128.png (128x128) - Chrome Web Store and installation

## Icon Design Guidelines

The Kana icons should feature:
- A brain or orb-like symbol
- Gradient colors matching the extension theme (blues/purples)
- Clean, modern design that's recognizable at small sizes
- Consistency across all sizes

## Creating the Icons

You can create the actual PNG files using:
1. Design software like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Canva
2. Online icon generators
3. AI image generators with prompts like "minimalist brain icon, gradient blue purple, clean design"

## Temporary Solution

Until real icons are created, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
2. Name them kana16.png, kana32.png, kana48.png, kana128.png
3. Place them in this icons/ directory

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
